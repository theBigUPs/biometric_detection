1. Specific Facial Features to Ensure Visibility
While I listed general features earlier, the standard emphasizes these specific landmarks and regions:

Entire face:
    From the top of the head (including hairline, unless bald) to the bottom of the chin.
    Coverage should also include lateral edges of the face.
Eyes:
    Both eyes must be visible and aligned horizontally.
    The gaze should be directly toward the camera.
Nose:
    The nose must be entirely visible, centered in the face, and free from shadows or distortions.
    Mouth:
    Mouth must be closed with no exaggerated expressions.
Ears:
    Ears should be visible (if not obscured by religious or medical accessories).
    For profiles, ears become critical for specific matching applications.
Chin and Jawline:
    Fully visible without obstruction from clothing, shadows, or other objects.
Eyebrows:
    Clearly visible without obstruction by hair or glasses.
Hairline:
    Where applicable, hair should not obscure the face or create excessive shadows.


2. Symmetry and Alignment
    The facial plane must be vertical (no tilt) and frontal.
    Symmetry is checked by ensuring:
        Both sides of the face are equally illuminated.
        No part of the face is skewed due to camera misalignment.


3. Pose and Perspective
    The standard has strict pose constraints:
        The head must be upright, and the face must be straight toward the camera (frontal pose).
        Pose variations like:
        Yaw (side-to-side turning): < ±5 degrees.
        Pitch (up or down tilt): < ±5 degrees.
        Roll (tilting the head sideways): < ±5 degrees.


4. Geometric Proportions
    The face must occupy at least 70-80% of the image height.
    The distance between the eyes (inter-eye distance) and other features should adhere to general biometric proportions:
        Inter-eye Distance: At least 90 pixels.
        Eye Level Position: The eyes should be at 50-70% of the image height from the top edge.
        The nose should fall on the vertical midline of the face.
        The mouth and chin should align proportionally to the rest of the face.


5. Image Quality Features
    Focus and Sharpness:
        No motion blur, and the facial features must be sharply defined.
        Sharpness can be measured using edge detection or Laplacian variance (as discussed earlier).
    Brightness and Contrast:
        The face must be evenly illuminated with minimal shadows.
        Brightness levels must ensure that facial features are distinct but not overexposed.
    Noise Level:
        Excessive noise is unacceptable. You can assess noise levels programmatically (e.g., using variance or entropy).


6. Accessories and Obstructions
    Glasses:
        Permitted, but the eyes must remain clearly visible.
        Glasses should not cause glare, reflections, or shadows.
    Hair:
        Should not obscure facial features.
    Headwear:
        Only allowed for religious or medical reasons and must not cover any biometric features (eyes, nose, mouth, chin).
7. Background Requirements
    The background should be plain, uniform, and of a contrasting color to the subject.
    Shadows on the background or inconsistent textures are not acceptable.


Inter-Feature Ratios:
    Validate ratios like:
        Eye-to-Nose Distance / Inter-Eye Distance.
        Nose-to-Mouth Distance / Eye-to-Chin Distance.
        Consistency with typical biometric proportions.
Lighting Uniformity:
    Detect if one side of the face is darker than the other (measure histogram differences).
Glasses Detection:
    Use OpenCV or pre-trained models to detect glare or obstruction caused by glasses.
Shadow Detection:
    Use edge detection to check for shadows over critical features (e.g., nose or eyes).
